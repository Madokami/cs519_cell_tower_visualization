# cs519_cell_tower_visualization
## background
This project contains a jupyter notebook which uses plotly bubble map (https://plotly.com/python/bubble-maps/) to visualize world cell tower coverage.
## setup
- Install jupyter notebook via anaconda
- Install plotly in the anaconda environment via "pip install plotly"

## data download
The world cell tower dataset is too large to get uploaded onto github, therefore it needs to be downloaded manually.
- Download the dataset of World cell towers from "https://www.opencellid.org/downloads.php". Note that an account would need to be created to get the API access token which is required to download data.
